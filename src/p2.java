" \n" +
"Uses  \n" +
"Used in steel making, production of methanol (CH3OH), welding, water purification, cement and rocket propulsion. It is also required for supporting life and combustion.  \n" +
"Oxygen is a major component of air, produced by plants during photosynthesis, and is necessary for aerobic respiration in animals.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Oxygen was first described by Michal Sedziwoj, a Polish alchemist and philosopher in the late 16th century. Sedziwoj thought of the gas given off by warm niter (saltpeter) as \"the elixir of life\".  \n" +
"Oxygen was more quantitatively discovered by the Swedish pharmacist Karl Wilhelm Scheele some time before 1773, but the discovery was not published until after the independent discovery by Joseph Priestley on August 1, 1774, who called the gas dephlogisticated air. Priestley published discoveries in 1775 and Scheele in 1777; consequently Priestley is usually given the credit. Both Scheele and Priestley produced oxygen by heating mercuric oxide.  \n" +
"Scheele called the gas 'fire air' because it was the only known supporter of combustion. It was later called 'vital air' because it was and is vital for the existence of animal life.  \n" +
"The gas was named by Antoine Laurent Lavoisier, after Priestley's publication in 1775, from Greek roots meaning \"acid-former\". As noted, the name reflects the then-common incorrect belief that all acids contain oxygen. This is also the origin of the Japanese name of oxygen \"sanso\" (san=acid, so=element).  \n" +
"Oxygen was first time condensed in 1883 by professors of Jagiellonian University - Zygmunt Wroblewski (Polish chemist) Karol Olszewski (Polish physicist and chemist).  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Liquid and solid O2 are both a light blue colour. Ozone (O3) is a deeper blue colour.  \n" +
"Oxygen is the second most common element on Earth, composing around 46% of the mass of Earth's crust (the most common element) and 28% of the mass of Earth as a whole, and is the third most common element in the universe. Forms almost 21% of atmosphere.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Hazards  \n" +
"Certain derivatives of oxygen, such as ozone (O3), singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radicals and superoxide (O2-), are highly toxic. Highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion and therefore are fire and explosion hazards in the presence of fuels."+"");

" \n" +
"Sources  \n" +

"Xenon is relatively rare in the Sun's atmosphere, on Earth, and in the asteroids and comets. The atmosphere of Mars shows a similar xenon abundance to that of Earth: 0.08 parts per million. However, Mars shows a higher proportion of 129Xe than the Earth or the Sun. As this isotope is generated by radioactive decay, the result may indicate that Mars lost most of its primordial atmosphere, possibly within the first 100 million years after the planet was formed. By contrast, the planet Jupiter has an unusually high abundance of xenon in its atmosphere; about 2.6 times as much as the Sun.  \n" +

" Universe: 0.01 ppm (by weight) \n" +
" Atmosphere: 0.86 ppm \n" +
" Earth's Crust: 2 x 10-6 ppm  \n" +
" Seawater: 1 x 10-4 ppm  \n" +
" \n" +
"Uses  \n" +
"Used in electronic flashes, projection lamps, UV lamps, and other powerful lamps. Also used in bubble chambers and paint testers. \n" +
"Preferred fuel for Ion Propulsion because of high molecular weight, ease of ionization, store as a liquid at near room temperature (but at high pressure) yet easily converts back into a gas to fuel the engine, inert nature makes it environmentally friendly and less corrosive to an ion engine than other fuels such as mercury or caesium.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Xenon was discovered in England by William Ramsay and Morris Travers on July 12, 1898, shortly after their discovery of the elements krypton and neon. They found it in the residue left over from evaporating components of liquid air.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Recently at the University of Helsinki in Finland some scientists have made HXeOH and HXeCCH (xenon hydride-hydroxide and hydroxenoacetylene), they are stable up to 40K.  \n" +
"Because xenon is heavier than air, the speed of sound in xenon is slower than that in air, and when inhaled, lowers the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. This produces a characteristic lowered voice pitch, analogous to the high-pitched voice caused by inhalation of helium. The inhalation of xenon is more dangerous than that inhalation of helium. Inhalation can cause mild-to-moderate, short-lasting effects, including a pounding sensation associated with light and sound.  \n" +
"Using gigapascals of pressure, xenon has been forced into a metallic phase. \n" +
" \n" +
"Hazards  \n" +
"Xenon is non-toxic, but many of its compounds are toxic due to their strong oxidative properties.  ");// TODO add your handling code here:

"Hydrogen's uses include: being used in the production of ammonia (NH3), ethanol (C2H5OH), hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen bromide (HBr); the hydrogenation of vegetable oils; hydrocracking, hydroforming and hydrofining of petroleum; atomic-hydrogen welding; instrument-carrying balloons; fuel in rockets; and cryogenic research. Its two heavier isotopes, deuterium (D) and tritium (T), are used respectively for nuclear fission and fusion.  \n" +
"Hydrogen fuel cells are being investigated as mobile power sources with lower emissions than hydrogen-burning internal combustion engines. The low emissions of hydrogen in internal combustion engines and fuel cells are currently offset by the pollution created by hydrogen production. This may change if the substantial amounts of electricity required for water electrolysis can be generated primarily from low pollution sources such as solar energy or wind. Research is being conducted on H2 as a replacement for fossil fuels.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Hydrogen gas, H2, was first artificially produced and formally described by T. Von Hohenheim (also known as Paracelsus, 1493 - 1541) via the mixing of metals with strong acids. He was unaware that the flammable gas produced by this chemical reaction was a new chemical element. In 1671, Robert Boyle rediscovered and described the reaction between iron filings and dilute acids, which results in the production of hydrogen gas. In 1766, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance, by identifying the gas from a metal-acid reaction as \"inflammable air\" and further finding that the gas produces water when burned. Cavendish had stumbled on hydrogen when experimenting with acids and mercury. Although he wrongly assumed that hydrogen was a liberated component of the mercury rather than the acid, he was still able to accurately describe several key properties of hydrogen. He is usually given credit for its discovery as an element. In 1783, Antoine Lavoisier gave the element the name of hydrogen when he (with Laplace) reproduced Cavendish's finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned. Lavoisier's name for the gas won out.  \n" +
"One of the first uses of H2 was for balloons, and later airships. The H2 was obtained by reacting sulphuric acid and metallic iron. Infamously, H2 was used in the Hindenburg airship that was destroyed in a midair fire. The highly flammable hydrogen (H2) was later replaced for airships and most balloons by the unreactive helium (He).  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas, H2, with a boiling point of 20.27 K, and a melting point of 14.02 K. Under extreme pressures, such as those at the center of gas giants, the molecules lose their identity and the hydrogen becomes a metal (metallic hydrogen). Under the extremely low pressure in space - virtually a vacuum - the element tends to exist as individual atoms, simply because it is statistically unlikely for them to combine.  \n" +
"A unique property of hydrogen is that its flame is nearly invisible in air.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Hazards  \n" +
"Hydrogen is a tasteless, colourless, odourless and extremely flammable gas, it is also the lightest chemical element. ");

"Dmitri Mendeleev used his periodic law, in 1869, to predict the existence of, and some properties of, three unknown elements, including one he called ekaboron .  \n" +
"Lars Fredrick Nilson and his team, apparently unaware of that prediction in the spring of 1879, were looking for rare earth metals. By using spectral analysis, they found a new element within the minerals euxenite and gadolinite. They named it scandium, from the Latin Scandia meaning \"Scandinavia\", and in the process of isolating the scandium, they processed 10 kilograms of euxenite, producing about 2.0 grams of a very pure scandium oxide (Sc2O3).  \n" +
"Per Teodor Cleve of Sweden concluded that scandium corresponded well to the hoped-for ekaboron, and he notified Mendeleev of this in August.  \n" +
"Fischer, Brunger, and Grienelaus prepared metallic scandium for the first time in 1937, by electrolysis of a eutectic melt of potassium, lithium, and scandium chlorides at a temperature of 700 to 800°C. Tungsten wires in a pool of liquid zinc were the electrodes in a graphite crucible. The first pound of 99% pure scandium metal was not produced until 1960.  \n" +

"It is used in stainless steel alloys for nuclear reactors, jets, missiles, cutting tools, pipelines, super magnets and welding rods. Because of its bluish colour, niobium is also used in body piercing jewellery (usually as an alloy).  \n" +
"Appreciable amounts of niobium in the form of high-purity ferroniobium and nickel niobium are used in nickel-, cobalt-, and iron-base superalloys for such applications as jet engine components, rocket subassemblies, and heat-resisting and combustion equipment.

"Niobium is also added to glass in order to attain a higher refractive index, a property used in the optical industry to make thinner corrective glasses.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Niobium (Greek mythology: Niobe, daughter of Tantalus) was discovered by Charles Hatchett in 1801. Hatchett found niobium in columbite ore that was sent to England in the 1750s by John Winthrop, the first governor of Connecticut. There was a considerable amount of confusion about the difference between the closely-related niobium and tantalum that wasn't resolved until 1846 by Heinrich Rose and Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac, who rediscovered the element. Since Rose was unaware of Hatchett's work, he gave the element a different name, niobium. In 1864 Christian Blomstrand was the first to prepare the pure metal, reducing niobium chloride by heating it in a hydrogen atmosphere.  \n" +
"Columbium (symbol Cb) was the name originally given to this element by Hatchett, but the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) officially adopted \"niobium\" as the name for element 41 in 1950 after 100 years of controversy. This was a compromise of sorts; the IUPAC accepted tungsten instead of wolfram, in deference to North American usage; and niobium instead of columbium, in deference to European usage. Not everyone agreed, however, and while many leading chemical societies and government organizations refer to it by the official IUPAC name, many leading metallurgists, metal societies, and most leading American commercial producers still refer to the metal by the original \"columbium.\"  \n" +

"In small quantities, molybdenum is effective at hardening steel. Used in aircraft, missiles, filaments in electric heaters and protective coatings in boiler plates. Molybdenum oranges are pigments ranging from red-yellow to a bright red orange and used in paints, inks, plastics, and rubber compounds.  \n" +
"Molybdenum disulfide is a good lubricant, especially at high temperatures. Molybdenum is also used in some electronic applications, as the conductive metal layers in thin-film transistors (TFTs).  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Molybdenite (MoS2)(from the Greek molybdos, meaning lead), the principal ore from which molybdenum is now extracted, was previously known as molybdena. Molybdena was confused with and often implemented as though it were graphite. Even when the two ores were distinguishable, molybdena was thought to be a lead ore. In 1754, Bengt Qvist examined the mineral and determined that it did not contain lead. It was not until 1778 that Swedish chemist Karl Wilhelm Scheele realized molybdena was neither graphite nor lead. He and other chemists then correctly assumed that it was the ore of a distinct new element, named molybdenum for the mineral in which it was discovered. Peter Jacob Hjelm successfully isolated molybdenum using carbon and linseed oil in 1781.  \n" +
"In World War I, some British tanks were protected by 75 mm manganese plating, but this proved to be ineffective. The manganese plates were then replaced with 25 mm molybdenum plating. These allowed for higher speed, greater manueverability and, despite being thinner, better protection.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Over 66% of all molybdenum is used in alloys.  \n" +
"Molybdenum has been found to have a role in the biology of all classes of organisms. It is found in two groups of enzymes, the nitrogenases and the molybdopterins.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Hazards  \n" +
"Molybdenum dusts and molybdenum compounds, such as molybdenum trioxide and water-soluble molybdates, may have slight toxicities if inhaled or ingested orally. Laboratory tests suggest, compared to many heavy metals, that molybdenum is of relatively low toxicity. Acute toxicity in humans is unlikely because the dose required would be exceptionally large.

"The technetium-99m isotope serves as a radiation source in medicine where it is used to locate tumours in the spleen, liver, brain, and thyroid. When 99mTc is combined with a tin compound it binds to red blood cells and can therefore be used to map circulatory system disorders. Technetium-99 is used for equipment calibration.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"For a number of years there was a gap in the periodic table between molybdenum (element 42) and ruthenium (element 44). Many early researchers were eager to be the first to discover and name the missing element; its location in the table suggested that it should be easier to find than other undiscovered elements. It was first thought to have been found in platinum ores in 1828. It was given the name polinium but it turned out to be impure iridium. Then in 1846 the element ilmenium was claimed to have been discovered but was determined to be impure niobium. This mistake was repeated in 1847 with the \"discovery\" of pelopium. Dmitri Mendeleev predicted that this missing element, as part of other predictions, would be chemically similar to manganese and gave it the name ekamanganese.  \n" +
"In 1877, the Russian chemist Serge Kern reported discovering the missing element in platinum ore. Kern named what he thought was the new element \"davyum\", after the noted English chemist Sir Humphry Davy, but it was determined to be a mixture of iridium, rhodium and iron. Another candidate, lucium, followed in 1896 but it was determined to be yttrium. Then in 1908 the Japanese chemist Masataka Ogawa found evidence in the mineral thorianite (ThO2) which he thought indicated the presence of element 43. Ogawa named the element nipponium, after Japan (which is Nippon in Japanese). In 2004 H. K YOSHIHARA utilized \"a record of X-ray spectrum of Ogawa's nipponium sample from thorianite [which] was contained in a photographic plate reserved by his family. The spectrum was read and indicated the absence of the element 43 and the presence of the element 75 (rhenium).\"  \n" +
"German chemists Walter Noddack, Otto Berg and Ida Tacke (later Mrs. Noddack) reported the discovery of element 75 and element 43 in 1925 and named element 43 masurium (after Masuria in eastern Prussia, now in Poland, the region where Walter Noddack's family originated). The group bombarded columbite with a beam of electrons and deduced element 43 was present by examining X-ray diffraction spectrograms. The wavelength of the X-rays produced is related to the atomic number by a formula derived by Henry Moseley in 1913. The team claimed to detect a faint X-ray signal at a wavelength produced by element 43. Contemporary experimenters could not replicate the discovery, and in fact it was dismissed as an error for many years.  \n" +
"Discovery of element 43 was finally confirmed in a 1937 experiment at the University of Palermo in Sicily conducted by Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segre. In the summer of 1936 Segre and his wife visited the United States, first New York at Columbia University, where he had spent time the previous summer, and then Berkeley at Lawrence's Radiation Laboratory. He persuaded cyclotron inventor Ernest Lawrence to let him take back some discarded cyclotron parts that had become radioactive. In early 1937 Lawrence mailed him a molybdenum foil that had been part of the deflector in the cyclotron. Segre enlisted his experienced chemist colleague Carlo Perrier to attempt to prove through comparative chemistry that the molybdenum activity was indeed Z = 43, an element not existent in nature because of its instability against nuclear decay. With considerable difficulty they finally succeeded in isolating three distinct decay periods (90, 80, and 50 days) that eventually turned out to be two isotopes, 95Tc and 97Tc, of technetium, the name given later by Perrier and Segre to the first man-made element. University of Palermo officials wanted them to name their discovery panormium, after the Latin name for Palermo, Panormus. The researchers instead named element 43 after the Greek word technetos, meaning \"artificial\", since it was the first element to be artificially produced. Segre returned to Berkeley and immediately sought out Glenn T Seaborg. They isolated the technetium-99m isotope which is now used in some 10,000,000 medical diagnostic procedures annually.  \n" +
"In 1952 astronomer Paul W. Merrill in California detected the spectral signature of technetium (in particular, light at 403.1 nm, 423.8 nm, 426.8 nm, and 429.7 nm) in light from S-type red giants. These massive stars near the end of their lives were rich in this short-lived element, meaning nuclear reactions within the stars must be producing it. This evidence was used to bolster the then unproven theory that stars are where nucleosynthesis of the heavier elements occurs. More recently, such observations provided evidence that elements were being formed by neutron capture in the s-process.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"First artificially created element.  \n" +
"All isotopes of technetium are radioactive but the element and its compounds are extremely rarely found in nature.  \n" +
"Most technetium produced on Earth is a by-product of fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and is extracted from nuclear fuel rods. On earth, technetium occurs naturally only in uranium ores as a product of spontaneous fission; the quantities are minute but have been measured.  \n" +
"No isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than 4.2 million years (98Tc), so its detection in red giants in 1952 helped bolster the theory that stars can produce heavier elements.  "+"");// TODO add your handling code here:

" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Ruthenium was discovered and isolated by Russian scientist Karl Klaus in 1844. Klaus showed that ruthenium oxide contained a new metal and obtained 6 grams of ruthenium from the part of crude platinum that is insoluble in aqua regia.  \n" +
"Jöns Berzelius and Gottfried Osann nearly discovered ruthenium in 1827. The men examined residues that were left after dissolving crude platinum from the Ural Mountains in aqua regia. Berzelius did not find any unusual metals, but Osann thought he found three new metals and named one of them ruthenium.  \n" +
"The name derives from Ruthenia the Latin word for Rus', a historical area which includes present day Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of the Russia, Baltics, Slovakia and Poland.

" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Rhodium was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston, soon after his discovery of palladium. They made this discovery in England using crude platinum ore that they presumably obtained from South America.  \n" +
"Their procedure involved dissolving the ore in aqua regia, neutralizing the acid with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). They then precipitated the platinum by adding ammonium chloride, NH4Cl, as ammonium chloroplatinate. The element palladium was removed as palladium cyanide after treating the solution with mercuric cyanide. The material that remained was a red rhodium(III) chloride: rhodium metal was isolated via reduction with hydrogen gas.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Rhodium metal does not normally form an oxide, even when heated. Oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere at the melting point of rhodium, but on solidification the oxygen is released.

In the 1950s, tiny beads of it were used for the emitters and collectors of alloy junction transistors. In the middle and late 1980s, the development of indium phosphide semiconductors and indium tin oxide thin films for liquid crystal displays (LCD) aroused much interest. By 1992, the thin-film application had become the largest end use.  \n" +
"Used to coat high speed bearings, in solar cells, mirrors, regulators in nuclear power, photo cells, the production of LCDs (this accounts for the majority of world-wide usage), transistors and blood and lung research.

"Indium (named after the indigo line in its atomic spectrum) was discovered by Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter in 1863 while they were testing zinc ores with a spectrograph in search of thallium.

"The Earth is estimated to contain about 0.1 ppm of indium which means it is about as abundant as silver, although indium is in fact nearly three times more expensive by weight.  \n" +
"One unusual property of indium is that its most common isotope is slightly radioactive; it very slowly decays by beta emission to tin.

" \n" +
"Name Origin  \n" +
"Greek: anti (opposed) monos (solitude). Sb comes from the latin, to mark. The exact origin of the name Antimony and the symbol Sb is a matter of much speculation, with little actual proof.  \n" +
" \"Antimony\" in different languages. \n" +
" \n" +
"Sources  \n" +
"Found in stibnite (Sb2S3) and in valentinite (Sb2O3). Even though this element is not abundant, it is found in over 100 mineral species.  \n" +
"The majority of antimony comes from China, other important reserves are found in Italy, Peru, Mexico, Bolivia and France. Annual production is around 53 thousand tons.  \n" +
" \n" +

" Universe: 0.0004 ppm (by weight) \n" +
" Sun: 0.001 ppm (by weight) \n" +

" Seawater: 2 x 10-4 ppm  \n" +
" \n" +
"Uses  \n" +
"Antimony is increasingly being used in the semiconductor industry in the production of diodes and infrared detectors. \n" +
"Used to the strength and hardness of lead alloys. The most important use of antimony is as a hardener in lead for storage batteries.  \n" +
"It is also used in small arm and tracer bullets, cable sheathing, matches, medicines, and bearings in internal cumbustion engines.  \n" +
"Antimony compounds in the form of oxides, sulfides, sodium antimonate (NaO3Sb), and antimony trichloride (SbCl3) are used in the making of flame-proofing compounds, ceramic enamels, glass, paints, and pottery. Antimony trioxide (Sb2O3) is the most important of the antimony compounds and is primarily used in flame-retardant formulations. These flame-retardant applications include such markets as children's clothing, toys, aircraft and automobile seat covers.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Antimony's sulfide compound, antimony (III) trisulfide, Sb2S3 was recognized in antiquity, at least as early as 3000 BC. Pastes of Sb2S3 powder in fat or in other materials have been used since that date as eye cosmetics in the Middle East and farther afield; in this use, Sb2S3 is called \"kohl\". It was used to darken the brows and lashes, or to draw a line around the perimeter of the eye.  \n" +
"An artefact made of antimony dating to about 3000 BC was found at Tello, Chaldea (part of present day Iraq), and a copper object plated with antimony dating between 2500 BC and 2200 BC has been found in Egypt.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Antimony in its elemental form is a silvery white, brittle, fusible, crystalline solid that exhibits poor electrical and heat conductivity properties and vapourizes at low temperatures. A metalloid, antimony resembles a metal in its appearance and physical properties, but does not chemically react as a metal. It is also attacked by oxidizing acids and halogens. Antimony and some of its alloys are unusual in that they expand on cooling.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Hazards  \n" +
"Antimony and many of its compounds are toxic. Clinically, antimony poisoning is very similar to arsenic poisoning. In small doses, antimony causes headache, dizziness, and depression. Larger doses cause violent and frequent vomiting, and will lead to death in few days. It is a skin, eye and respiratory irritant.  ");// TODO add your handling code here:

"Uses  \n" +
"Used to improve the machining quality of metal products and to colour glass and ceramics. Also used in thermoelectric devices (bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3)), vulcanization of rubber, percussion caps, battery plate protectors and electrical resistors.  \n" +
"It is added to lead to improve its strength and durability, and to decrease the corrosive action of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). When added to stainless steel and copper it makes these metals more workable. It is alloyed into cast iron for chill control.  \n" +
"When alloyed with both cadmium and mercury, to form mercury cadmium telluride, an infrared sensitive semiconductor material is formed.  \n" +
"Tellurium is being used (as GeSbTe, an alloy of germanium, antimony and tellurium) in the new phase change memory chips developed by Intel.  \n" +
"Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is used in solar panels. NREL lab tests using this material achieved some of the highest efficiencies for solar cell electric power generation.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Tellurium (Latin tellus meaning \"earth\") was discovered in 1782 by the Hungarian Franz-Joseph Muller von Reichenstein (Muller Ferenc) in Nagyszeben (now, Sibiu) Transylvania. In 1789, another Hungarian scientist, Pal Kitaibel, also discovered the element independently, but later he gave the credit to Muller. In 1798, it was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth who earlier isolated it.  \n" +
"Tellurium was used as a chemical bonder in the making of the outer shell of the first atom bomb. The 1960s brought growth in thermoelectric applications for tellurium, as well as its use in free-machining steel, which became the dominant use.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"It is chemically related to selenium and sulfur, the conductivity of this element increases slightly when exposed to light. It can be doped with copper, gold, silver, tin, or other metals. Tellurium gives a greenish-blue flame when burned in normal air and forms tellurium dioxide as a result. When in its molten state, tellurium is corrosive to copper, iron, and stainless steel.  \n" +
"128Te has the longest known half-life, 2.2 x 1024 years, among all radioactive isotopes.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Hazards  \n" +
"Humans exposed to as little as 0.01 mg/m3 or less in air develop \"tellurium breath\", which has a garlic-like odour. The garlic odour that is associated with human intake of tellurium compounds is caused from the tellurium being metabolized by the body. When the body metabolizes tellurium in any oxidation state, the tellurium gets converted into dimethyl telluride, which is volatile and produces the garlic-like smell.  \n" +

" \n" +
"Uses  \n" +
"Used in alloys such as zircaloy which is used in nuclear applications since it does not readily absorb neutrons. Also used in catalytic converters, percussion caps and furnace bricks. Baddeleyite is used in lab crucibles. Zirconium nitride (ZrN) has been used more recently as an alternative to titanium nitride for coating drill bits. Both coatings are supposed to keep the bit sharper and cooler during cutting.  \n" +
"Extensively used by the chemical industry for piping in corrosive environments. \n" +
"Because human tissues can easily tolerate this metal it is suitable for biocompatible implants, eg. some artificial joints and limbs.  \n" +
"When alloyed with niobium, zirconium becomes superconductive at low temperatures and is used to make superconductive magnets with possible large-scale electrical power uses.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Although it was discovered in 1789 by Martin Heinrich Klaproth it wasn't isolated until 1824, by Jöns Jakob Berzelius.  \n" +
"The zirconium-containing mineral zircon, or its variations (jargon, hyacinth, jacinth, or ligure), were mentioned in biblical writings. The mineral was not known to contain a new element until Klaproth analyzed a jargon from Ceylon in the Indian Ocean. He named the new element Zirkonertz (zirconia). The impure metal was isolated first by Berzelius by heating a mixture of potassium and potassium-zirconium fluoride in a small decomposition process conducted in an iron tube. Pure zirconium wasn't prepared until 1914.  \n" +
"The crystal bar process (or Iodide process), discovered by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925, was the first industrial process for the commercial production of pure ductile metallic zirconium. It was superseded by the Kroll process.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"This element has been detected in the sun and meteorites. Lunar rock samples brought back from several Apollo program missions to the moon have a very high zirconium oxide content relative to terrestrial rocks.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Hazards  \n" +
"Compounds containing zirconium are not noted for toxicity. The metal dust can ignite in air and should be regarded as a major fire and explosion hazard.  "+"");

"Lithium is widely distributed but does not occur in nature in its free form. Because of its reactivity, it is always found bound with one or more other elements or compounds. Found in trace amounts in the minerals; spodumene (LiAl(SiO3)2), amblygonite (Li,Na)AlPO4(F,OH)), lepidolite (KLi2Al(Al,Si)3O10(F,OH)2). Most commercial lithium is recovered from brines sources in Chile. Also obtained by passing electric charge through melted lithium chloride.  \n" +

"Used in batteries, ceramics, glass, lubricants, alloy hardeners, pharmaceuticals, hydrogenating agents, heat transfer liquids, rocket propellants, vitamin A synthesis, nuclear reactor coolant, underwater buoyancy devices and the production of tritium. Deoxidizer in copper and copper alloys.  \n" +
"Alloys of the metal with aluminium, cadmium, copper, and manganese are used to make high performance aircraft parts.  \n" +
"Lithium salts such as lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), lithium citrate, and lithium orotate are mood stabilizers (the effect is due to the lithium ion, so the type of salt is unimportant). They are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, since unlike most other mood altering drugs, they counteract both mania and depression. Lithium can also be used to augment other antidepressant drugs. Useful amounts of lithium for this use are only slightly lower than toxic amounts, so the blood levels of lithium must be carefully monitored during such treatment.  \n" +
"Lithium metal is used as a catalyst in some types of methamphetamine production, particularly in illegal amateur \"meth labs.\"  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Petalite (LiAlSi4O10), which has lithium in it, was discovered by the Brazilian scientist Jose Bonifacio de Andrade e Silva in the late 1700s on a trip to Sweden. Lithium was discovered by Johan August Arfwedson in 1817. Arfwedson found the new element within the minerals spodumene and lepidolite in a petalite ore (LiAl(Si2O5)2) that he was analyzing during a routine investigation of some minerals from a mine on the island Uto in Sweden. In 1818 Christian Gmelin was the first to observe that lithium salts give a bright red colour in flame. Both men tried and failed to isolate the element from its salts.  \n" +
"The element was not isolated until William Thomas Brande and Sir Humphry Davy later used electrolysis on lithium oxide in 1818. Robert Bunsen and Matiessen isolated larger quantities of the metal by electrolysis of lithium chloride in 1855. Commercial production of lithium metal was achieved in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft through using electrolysis of molten lithium chloride and potassium chloride. It was apparently given the name \"lithium\" because it was discovered from a mineral while other common alkali metals were first discovered from plant tissue.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Lithium is a soft, silvery metal, so soft that it can be cut with a sharp knife. It is the lightest of all metals and has a density only half that of water.  \n" +
"Lithium is one of only three elements - and the only metal - created in the first moments of the Big Bang. (The other two elements are hydrogen and helium, which according to cosmologists, were created in much greater abundance than lithium.)  \n" +
" \n" +
"Hazards  \n" +
"Lithium causes serious burns, especially when in contact with damp skin. Contact with the eyes may cause serious permanent damage.  \n" +
"It is the only metal that reacts with nitrogen at room temperature. Near its melting point, lithium ignites in air. Lithium posses a dangerous fire and explosion risk when exposed to water, acids or oxidizing agents. Lithium fires are difficult to extinguish, requiring special chemicals designed to smother them. It reacts exothermally with nitrogen in moist air at high temperatures. In solution lithium is toxic and targets the central nervous system.  ");// TODO add your handling code here:

"Uses  \n" +
"Used in balloons as it is lighter than air, and unlike hydrogen, not flammable; deep sea diving and welding. Also used in very low temperature research and nuclear power plant coolant. Future possible uses include use as coolant for nuclear fusion power plants and in superconducting electric systems.  \n" +
"At extremely low temperatures, liquid helium is used to cool certain metals to produce superconductivity, such as in superconducting magnets used in magnetic resonance imaging. Helium at low temperatures is also used in cryogenics.  \n" +
"Because it is inert, helium is used as a protective gas in growing silicon and germanium crystals, in titanium and zirconium production, in gas chromatography, and as an atmosphere for protecting historical documents. This property also makes it useful in supersonic wind tunnels.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Evidence of helium was first detected on August 18, 1868 as a bright yellow line with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometres in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun, by French astronomer Pierre Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India. This line was initially assumed to be sodium. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer Norman Lockyer observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which he named the D3 line, for it was near the known D1 and D2 lines of sodium, and concluded that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth. He and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with the Greek word for the Sun.  \n" +
"On 26 March 1895 British chemist William Ramsay isolated helium on Earth by treating the mineral cleveite with mineral acids. Ramsay was looking for argon but, after separating nitrogen and oxygen from the gas liberated by sulfuric acid, noticed a bright-yellow line that matched the D3 line observed in the spectrum of the Sun. These samples were identified as helium by Lockyer and British physicist William Crookes. It was independently isolated from cleveite the same year by chemists Per Teodor Cleve and Abraham Langlet in Uppsala, Sweden, who collected enough of the gas to accurately determine its atomic weight. Helium was also isolated by the American geochemist William Francis Hillebrand prior to Ramsay's discovery when he noticed unusual spectral lines while testing a sample of the mineral uraninite. Hillebrand, however, attributed the lines to nitrogen. His letter of congratulations to Ramsay offers an interesting case of discovery and near-discovery in science.  \n" +
"In 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds demonstrated that an alpha particle is a helium nucleus. In 1908, helium was first liquefied by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling the gas to less than one kelvin. He tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not have a triple point temperature where the solid, liquid, and gas phases are at equilibrium. It was first solidified in 1926 by his student Willem Hendrik Keesom by subjecting helium to 25 atmospheres of pressure.  \n" +
"In 1938, Russian physicist Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa discovered that helium-4 has almost no viscosity at temperatures near absolute zero, a phenomenon now called superfluidity. In 1972, the same phenomenon was observed in helium-3 by American physicists Douglas D. Osheroff, David M. Lee, and Robert C. Richardson.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Helium has the lowest melting and boiling point of any element. Liquid Helium is called a \"quantum fluid\" as it displays atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. The viscosity of liquid helium is 25 micropoises (water has a viscosity of 10,000 micropoises). As helium is cooled below its transition point, it has an unusual property of superfluidity with a viscosity approaching zero micropoises. In addition, liquid helium has extremely high thermal conductivity.  \n" +
"Helium is the second most abundant and second lightest element in the periodic table. It is also the least reactive of all the group 18 (noble gases) elements.  \n" +
"One cubic metre of helium will lift 1kg. Helium is the preferred choice for airships as although it is more expensive it is not flammable and has 92% the lifting power of hydrogen.  \n" +
"The voice of a person who has inhaled helium temporarily sounds high-pitched, resembling those of the cartoon characters \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\". This is because the speed of sound in helium is nearly three times that in air. Although the vocal effect of inhaling helium may be amusing, it can be dangerous if done to excess since helium is a simple asphyxiant, thus it displaces oxygen needed for normal respiration. Death by asphyxiation will result within minutes if pure helium is breathed continuously.  \n" +

"Its ability to absorb large amounts of heat makes it useful in spacecraft, missiles, aircraft, etc. Emeralds are beryl crystals with chromium traces giving them their green colour. Also used in light weight metal alloys, X-ray tube windows, watch springs and sparkless tools.  \n" +
"Beryllium oxide (BeO) is useful for many applications that require an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, with a very high melting point, and that acts as an electrical insulator.  \n" +
"Beryllium is also used in the making of gyroscopes, various computer equipment, watch springs and instruments where light-weight, rigidity and dimensional stability are needed.  \n" +
"The James Webb Space Telescope, will have 18 hexagonal beryllium sections for its mirrors. Because the JWST will face a temperature of -240 degrees Celsius (30 kelvins), the mirror is made of beryllium, a material capable of handling extreme cold better than glass. Beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass, and thus remains more uniform, in such temperatures.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +

"Boron slurry is used as an energetic material with very high energy density like rocket fuels and jet engines. \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Compounds of boron have been known of for thousands of years. In early Egypt, mummification depended upon an ore known as natron, which contained borates as well as some other common salts. Borax glazes were used in China from 300 AD, and boron compounds were used in glassmaking in ancient Rome.  \n" +
"The element was not isolated until 1808 by Sir Humphry Davy, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, and Louis Jacques Thenard, to about 50 percent purity, by the reduction of boric acid with sodium or magnesium. These men did not recognize the substance as an element. It was Jöns Jakob Berzelius in 1824 that identified boron as an element. The first pure boron was produced by the American chemist W. Weintraub in 1909, although this is disputed by some researchers.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"At standard temperatures boron is a poor electrical conductor but is a good conductor at high temperatures. \n" +
"Boron nitride can be used to make materials that are almost as hard as diamond. The nitride also acts as an electrical insulator but conducts heat similar to a metal. This element also has lubricating qualities that are similar to graphite.  \n" +
"Boron is never found in the elemental form in nature. It was first obtained by Moissan in 1895 by reduction of boric anhydride with magnesium in a thermite-type reaction. This is still used for obtaining large quantities of impure boron. Highly purified crystalline boron is obtained by vapour phase reduction of the compound boron trichloride with hydrogen on electrically heated filaments in a flow system.  \n" +
"The United States and Turkey are the world's largest producers of boron.  \n" +

"Nitrogen has many industrial uses in the gaseous forms, but probably the most interesting is liquid nitrogen, which is extremely cold. Items that must be frozen to extremely low temperatures for preservation are frequently stored in liquid nitrogen. Fertility clinics store sperm, eggs and embryos used to help infertile couples become pregnant in ampoules in liquid nitrogen. Since nitrogen gas is very stable, at standard temperature and pressure, it is used as the air in inert welding atmospheres. Documents, foods and chemicals are sometimes stored in nitrogen to keep them from oxidizing or reacting with air or water.  \n" +
" \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Nitrogen is the largest single component of the Earth's atmosphere (78.084% by volume, 75.5% by weight). \n" +
"Nitrogen in the elemental form was considered to be inert and was even named ozote which refers to the fact that it is not reactive. Of course nitrogen does form compounds, but the gaseous form consists of diamers (2 nitrogens bonded together). The diamer is very stable.  \n" +
"Nitrogen is a major element in organic compounds, especially proteins. Some nitrogen compounds are highly reactive. Trinitrotoluene is TNT or dynamite. Ammonium Nitrate is a fertilizer, but was used as the major explosive ingredient in the Oklahoma City bombing. Anfo, or Ammonium Nitrate and fuel oil mixture is the primary explosive used in the mining industry because it is inexpensive, easy to manufacture and can be easily manufactured near the mine site thus reducing the risks and expenses related to the transportation of explosives. Nitrates, Nitrites and Azides (all nitrogen compounds are either oxidizers or reactives and will react violently under the right conditions.  \n" +
"The triple bond in molecular nitrogen (N2) is one of the strongest in nature. The resulting difficulty of converting (N2) into other compounds, and the ease (and associated high energy release) of converting nitrogen compounds into elemental N2, have dominated the role of nitrogen in both nature and human economic activities.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Hazards  \n" +
"Rapid release of nitrogen gas into an enclosed space can displace oxygen, and therefore represents an asphyxiation hazard. Nitrogen also dissolves in the bloodstream, and rapid decompression (particularly in the case of divers ascending too quickly) can lead to a potentially fatal condition called decompression sickness, when nitrogen bubbles form in the bloodstream. It can also cause nitrogen narcosis. "+"");

Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is an extremely inert and nontoxic gas, and a member of a class of compounds that are potent greenhouse gases.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Fluorine in the form of fluorspar (also called fluorite (CaF2)) (calcium fluoride) was described in 1530 by Georgius Agricola for its use as a flux, which is a substance that is used to promote the fusion of metals or minerals. In 1670 Schwanhard found that glass was etched when it was exposed to fluorspar that was treated with acid. Karl Wilhelm Scheele and many later researchers, including Humphry Davy, Gay-Lussac, Antoine Lavoisier, and Louis Thenard all would experiment with hydrofluoric acid, easily obtained by treating calcium fluoride (fluorspar) with concentrated sulfuric acid.  \n" +
"It was eventually realized that hydrofluoric acid contained a previously unknown element. This element was not isolated for many years after this, due to its extreme reactivity; fluorine can only be prepared from its compounds electrolytically, and then it immediately attacks any susceptible materials in the area. Finally, in 1886, elemental fluorine was isolated by Henri Moissan after almost 74 years of continuous effort by other chemists. It was an effort which cost several researchers their health or even their lives. The derivation of elemental fluorine from hydrofluoric acid is exceptionally dangerous, killing or blinding several scientists who attempted early experiments on this halogen. These men came to be referred to as \"fluorine martyrs.\" For Moissan, it earned him the 1906 Nobel Prize in chemistry (Moissan himself lived to be 54, and it is not clear whether his fluorine work shortened his life).  \n" +
"The first large-scale production of fluorine was needed for the atomic bomb Manhattan project in World War II where the compound uranium hexafluoride (UF6) was needed as a gaseous carrier of uranium to separate the 235U and 238U isotopes of uranium. Today both the gaseous diffusion process and the gas centrifuge process use gaseous UF6 to produce enriched uranium for nuclear power applications. In the Manhattan Project, it was found that elemental fluorine was present whenever UF6 was, due to the spontaneous decomposition of this compound into UF4 and F2. The corrosion problem due to the F2 was eventually solved by electrolytically coating all UF6 carrying piping with nickel metal, which resists fluorine's attack. Joints and flexible parts were made from Teflon, then a very recently-discovered fluorine-containing plastic which was not attacked by F2.  \n" +

"Pure fluorine is a very reactive and corrosive gas, with a pungent odour. Both fluorine and HF must be handled with great care and any contact with skin and eyes should be strictly avoided. Contact with exposed skin may result in the HF molecule rapidly migrating through the skin and flesh into the bone where it reacts with calcium permanently damaging the bone, followed by cardiac arrest brought on by sudden chemical changes within the body.  \n" +

" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Sodium (the English word for which is soda) has long been recognized in compounds, but was not isolated until 1807 by Sir Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of caustic soda. In medieval Europe a compound of sodium with the Latin name of sodanum was used as a headache remedy.  \n" +
"Sodium's chemical abbreviation Na was first published by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in his system of atomic symbols (Thomas Thomson's Annals of Philosophy) and is a contraction of the element's new Latin name natrium which refers to natron, a natural mineral salt whose primary ingredient is hydrated sodium carbonate and which historically had several important industrial and household uses later eclipsed by soda ash, baking soda and other sodium compounds.  \n" +
"Sodium imparts an intense yellow colour to flames. As early as 1860, Kirchhoff and Bunsen noted the high sensitivity that a flame test for sodium could give.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Sodium comes from the English word \"soda\" and from medieval Latin sodanum which means headache remedy. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element on earth comprising 2.6% of the earth's crust. It is the most abundant of the alkali metals. It never exists in nature, but is prepared by electrolysis of absolutely dry fused sodium chloride. Sodium chloride is common table salt which is important in animal nutrition. Other important forms of sodium are soda ash (Na2CO3), baking soda (NaHCO3), Chili saltpeter (NaNO3) which is sodium nitrate. In nature sodium is found in soda niter, cryolite (Na3AlF6), amphibole and zeolite.  \n" +
"Sodium ions are necessary for regulation of blood and body fluids, transmission of nerve impulses, heart activity, and certain metabolic functions. It is widely considered that most people in Western countries consume more than is needed, in the form of sodium chloride, or table salt, and that this can have a negative effect on health.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Hazards  \n" +
"Sodium's metallic form is highly explosive in water and is a poison when uncombined with other elements. The powdered form may combust spontaneously in air or oxygen. This metal should be handled carefully at all times. Sodium must be stored either in an inert atmosphere, or under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene.  \n" +
"The reaction of sodium and water is a familiar one in chemistry labs, and is reasonably safe if amounts of sodium smaller than a pencil eraser are used, and the reaction is done behind a plastic shield glass by people wearing eye protection. However, the sodium-water reaction does not scale well, and is treacherous when larger amounts of sodium are used. Larger pieces of sodium melt under the heat of the reaction, and the molten ball of metal is buoyed up by hydrogen and appears to be stably reacting with water until splashing covers more of the reaction mass, causing thermal runaway and an explosion which scatters molten sodium and lye.  \n" +
"There are only a very few materials that will put out a sodium metal fire, like Pyromet and Met-L-X. Pyromet is a NaCl/(NH4)2HPO4 mix, with flow/anti-clump agents. It smoothers the fire, drains away heat, and melts to form an impermeable crust. This is the standard dry-powder cannister fire extingusher for all classes of fires. Met-L-X is mostly just NaCl, with about 5 % Saran as a crust-former, and a couple of flow/anti-clump agents, and is most commonly hand-applied with a scoop. There are also other exreme fire extinguishing materials - lith-X is a graphite based dry powder with an organophosphate flame retardant, and Na-X is a Na2CO3-based material.

"Kitchen utensils, building decorations, electrical transmission (not nearly as conductive as copper, but cheaper) as well as packaging (can, foil etc.). Aluminium alloys form vital components of aircraft and rockets as a result of their high strength to weight ratio. Alloys containing copper, magnesium, silicon, manganese and other metals are much stronger and more durable than aluminium, making aluminium useful in the manufacture of aircraft and rockets.  \n" +
"Most electronic appliances that require cooling of their internal devices (like transistors, CPUs - semiconductors in general) have heat sinks that are made of aluminium due to its ease of manufacture and good heat conductivity. Copper heat sinks are smaller although more expensive and harder to manufacture.  \n" +

"History  \n" +
"The ancient Greeks and Romans used aluminium salts as dyeing mordants and as astringents for dressing wounds. In 1761 Guyton de Morveau suggested calling the base alum alumine. In 1808, Humphry Davy identified the existence of a metal base of alum, which he at first named alumium and later aluminum.  \n" +
"Friedrich Wöhler is generally credited with isolating aluminium (Latin alumen, alum) in 1827 by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium. The metal, however, had indeed been produced for the first time two years earlier - but in an impure form - by the Danish physicist and chemist Hans Christian Orsted. Therefore, Orsted can also be listed as the discoverer of the metal. Further, Pierre Berthier discovered aluminium in bauxite ore and successfully extracted it. The Frenchman Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville improved Wöhler's method in 1846 and described his improvements in a book in 1859, chief among these being the substitution of sodium for the considerably more expensive potassium.  \n" +
"Aluminium was selected as the material to be used for the apex of the Washington Monument, at a time when one ounce (30 grams) cost twice the daily wages of a common worker in the project; aluminium was a semiprecious metal at that time.  \n" +

"It an important component in steel production, in the making of phosphor bronze, and in many other related products. Red phosphorus is essential for manufacturing matchbook strikers, flares, and, most notoriously, methamphetamine.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Phosphorus (Greek phosphoros was the ancient name for the planet Venus, but in Greek mythology, Hesperus and Eosphorus could be confused with Phosphorus) was discovered by German alchemist Hennig Brand in 1669 through a preparation from urine, which naturally contains considerable quantities of dissolved phosphates from normal metabolism. Working in Hamburg, Brand attempted to distill some salts by evaporating urine, and in the process produced a white material that glowed in the dark and burned brilliantly. Since that time, phosphorescence has been used to describe substances that shine in the dark without burning.  \n" +
"Phosphorus was first made commercially, for the match industry, in the 19th century, by distilling off phosphorus vapour from precipitated phosphates heated in a retort. The precipitated phosphates were made from ground-up bones that had been de-greased and treated with strong acids. This process became obsolete in the late 1890s when the electric arc furnace was adapted to reduce phosphate rock.  \n" +
"Early matches used white phosphorus in their composition, which was dangerous due to its toxicity. Murders, suicides and accidental poisonings resulted from its use. (An apocryphal tale tells of a woman attempting to murder her husband with white phosphorus in his food, which was detected by the stew giving off luminous steam). In addition, exposure to the vapours gave match workers a necrosis of the bones of the jaw, the infamous \"phossy jaw.\" When a safe process for manufacturing red phosphorus was discovered, with its far lower flammability and toxicity, laws were enacted, under a Berne Convention, requiring its adoption as a safer alternative for match manufacture.  \n" +
"The electric furnace method allowed production to increase to the point phosphorus could be used in weapons of war. In World War I it was used in incendiaries, smoke screens and tracer bullets. A special incendiary bullet was developed to shoot at hydrogen filled Zeppelins over Britain (hydrogen of course being highly flammable if it can be ignited). During World War II Molotov cocktails of benzene and phosphorus were distributed in Britain to specially selected civilians within the British Resistance Operation, for defence; and phosphorus incendiary bombs were used in War on a large scale. Burning phosphorus is difficult to extinguish and if it splashes onto human skin it has horrific effects (see precautions below). People covered in it were known to commit suicide due to the torment.  \n" +
"Today phosphorus production is larger than ever, used as a precursor for various chemicals, in particular the herbicide glyphosate sold under the brand name Roundup. Production of white phosphorus takes place at large facilities and is transported heated in liquid form. Some major accidents have occurred during transportation, train derailments at Brownston, Nebraska and Miamisburg, Ohio lead to large fires. The worst accident in recent times though was an environmental one in 1968 when phosphorus spilt into the sea from a plant at Placentia Bay, Newfoundland.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Phosphorus exists in three allotropic forms: white, red, and black. The most common are red and white phosphorus. White phosphorus burns on contact with air and on exposure to heat or light.  \n" +
"Phosphorus is a key element in all known forms of life. Living cells also utilize phosphate to transport cellular energy via adenosine triphosphate (ATP). An average person contains a little less than 1 kg of phosphorus, about three quarters of which is present in bones and teeth in the form of apatite. Phosphate salts are used by animals to stiffen their bones.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Hazards  \n" +
"Just 50mg of phosphorus is considered a lethal dose. The allotrope white phosphorus should be kept under water at all times as it presents a significant fire hazard due to its extreme reactivity to atmospheric oxygen, and it should only be manipulated with forceps since contact with skin can cause severe burns.

"Glass treated with liquid potassium is much stronger than regular glass. \n" +
"Potassium chloride (KCl) is used as a substitute for table salt and is also used to stop the heart, e.g. in cardiac surgery and in executions by lethal injection in solution.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Potassium was discovered in 1807 by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH). Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Potassium is the second least dense metal; only lithium is less dense. It is a soft, low-melting solid that can easily be cut with a knife. Freshly cut potassium is silvery in appearance, but in air it begins to tarnish toward grey immediately.  \n" +
"Potassium is a necessary mineral in daily nutrition; it assists in muscle contraction and in maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance in body cells.  \n" +
"Formerly called kalium hence the symbol 'K'. \n" +
" \n" +
"Hazards  \n" +
"Solid potassium reacts violently with water, and should therefore be kept under a mineral oil such as kerosene and handled with care. When in water, it may catch fire spontaneously, burning with a purple flame. Unlike lithium and sodium however, potassium cannot be stored under oil indefinitely. If stored longer than 6 months to a year, dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under the lid of the container that can detonate upon opening.  \n" +
"Potassium is very harmful by ingestion or through the skin or eye contact, it may cause irreversible eye damage. "+"");// TODO add your handling code here:

" \n" +
"Uses  \n" +
"Titanium is well known for its excellent resistance to corrosion; it is almost as resistant as platinum, being able to withstand attack by acids, moist chlorine gas, and by common salt solutions.  \n" +
"Because of its high tensile strength (even at high temperatures), light weight, extraordinary corrosion resistance, and ability to withstand extreme temperatures, titanium alloys are used in aircraft (a Boeing 737 contains around 18 tons, a 777 around 58 tons), armour plating, naval ships, spacecraft and missiles. It is used in steel alloys to reduce grain size and as a deoxidizer, and in stainless steel to reduce carbon content. Titanium is often alloyed with aluminium (to refine grain size), vanadium, copper (to harden), iron, manganese, molybdenum and with other metals.  \n" +
"Because it is considered to be physiologically inert, the metal is used in joint replacement implants such as hip ball and sockets and to make medical equipment and in pipe/tank lining in food processing. Since titanium is non-ferromagnetic patients with titanium implants can be safely examined with magnetic resonance imaging, which makes it convenient for long term implants and surgical instruments for use in image-guided surgery.  \n" +
"95% of titanium production is consumend in the form of titanium dioxide (TiO2), a white pigment that covers surfaces very well, is used in paint, rubber, paper and many other materials. Also used in heat exchangers, airplane motors, bone pins and other things requiring light weight metals or metals that resist corrosion or high temperatures. Titanium oxide is used extensively in paints and in suncreens.  \n" +
"Due to excellent resistance to sea water, it is used to make propeller shafts and rigging and in the heat exchangers of desalination plants and in heater-chillers for salt water aquariums, and lately diver knives as well.  \n" +
"Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a colourless liquid, is used to iridize glass and because it fumes strongly in moist air it is also used to make smoke screens and in skywriting.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Titanium was discovered combined in a mineral in Cornwall, England in 1791 by amateur geologist William Gregor, the then vicar of Creed village. He recognized the presence of a new element in ilmenite (FeTiO3) when he found black sand by a stream in the nearby parish of Manaccan and noticed the sand was attracted by a magnet. Analysis of the sand determined the presence of two metal oxides; iron oxide (explaining the attraction to the magnet) and 45.25% of a white metallic oxide he could not identify. Gregor, realizing that the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match the properties of any known element, reported his findings to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall and in the German science journal Crell's Annalen.  \n" +
"Around the same time, Franz Joseph Muller also produced a similar substance, but could not identify it. The oxide was independently rediscovered in 1795 by German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in rutile from Hungary. Klaproth found that it contained a new element and named it for the Titans of Greek mythology. After hearing about Gregor's earlier discovery, he obtained a sample of manaccanite and confirmed it contained titanium.  \n" +
"The processes required to extract titanium from its various ores are laborious and costly; it is not possible to reduce in the normal manner, by heating in the presence of carbon, because that produces titanium carbide. Pure metallic titanium (99.9%) was first prepared in 1910 by Matthew A. Hunter by heating TiCl4 with sodium in a steel bomb at 700 - 800°C in the Hunter process. Titanium metal was not used outside the laboratory until 1946 when William Justin Kroll proved that it could be commercially produced by reducing titanium tetrachloride with magnesium in what came to be known as the Kroll process. Although research continues into more efficient and cheaper processes (FFC Cambridge, e.g.), the Kroll process is still used for commercial production.  \n" +
"Titanium of very high purity was made in small quantities when Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer discovered the iodide, or crystal bar, process in 1925, by reacting with iodine and decomposing the formed vapours over a hot filament to pure metal.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Pure titanium is a lustrous white metal, as strong as steel, 45% lighter, 60% heavier than aluminium.  \n" +
"Titanium is Latin and refers to the Titans, the first sons of the earth in Mythology. It was discovered by Gregor in 1791 and named by Klaproth four years later. It was nearly a hundred years later (1887) when impure titanium was first prepared by Nilson and Pettersson. About 20 years later Hunter heated Titanium Chloride TiCl4 with sodium in a steel bomb and isolated 99.6% pure titanium. It is the ninth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and is also found in meteorites and in the sun. It is found in the ash of coal, in plants and even in the human body. It occurs in the minerals rutile (TiO2), ilmenite (FeTiO3) and sphene (CaTiSiO5).  \n" +
"As a compound, it is found as Titanium dioxide TiO2 in star sapphires and rubies (it is TiO2 that gives them their asterism). It is also found as titanium chloride (TiCl4). When it is red hot the metal combines with oxygen, and when it reaches 550°C it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Hazards  \n" +
"As a powder or in the form of metal shavings, titanium metal poses a significant fire hazard and, when heated in air, an explosion hazard. Water and carbon dioxide-based methods to extinguish fires are ineffective on burning titanium.  \n" +

"History  \n" +
"Vanadium was originally discovered by Andres Manuel del Rio (a Spanish-born Mexican mineralogist) in Mexico City, in 1801. He called it \"brown lead\" (now named vanadinite, Pb5(VO4)3Cl). Through experimentation, its colours reminded him of chromium, so he named the element panchromium. He later renamed this compound erythronium, since most of the salts turned red when heated. The French chemist Hippolyte Victor Collet-Descotils incorrectly declared that del Rio's new element was only impure chromium. Del Rio thought himself to be mistaken and accepted the statement of the French chemist that was also backed by Del Rio's friend Baron Alexander von Humboldt.  \n" +
"In 1831, Sefstrom of Sweden rediscovered vanadium in a new oxide he found while working with some iron ores and later that same year Friedrich Wöhler confirmed del Rio's earlier work. Later, George William Featherstonhaugh, one of the first US geologists, suggested that the element should be named \"rionium\" after Del Rio, but this never happened. Metallic vanadium was isolated by Henry Enfield Roscoe in 1867, who reduced vanadium(III) chloride VCl3 with hydrogen. The name vanadium comes from Vanadis, a goddess in Scandinavian mythology, because the element has beautiful multicoloured chemical compounds  \n" +

"On 26th July 1761, Johann Gottlob Lehmann found an orange-red mineral in the Ural Mountains which he named Siberian red lead.

"In 1770, Peter Simon Pallas visited the same site as Lehmann and found a red \"lead\" mineral that had very useful properties as a pigment in paints. The use of Siberian red lead as a paint pigment developed rapidly. A bright yellow made from crocoite became a colour in fashion.  \n" +
"In 1797, Louis Nicolas Vauquelin received samples of crocoite ore. He was able to produce chromium oxide with a chemical formula of CrO3, by mixing crocoite with hydrochloric acid. In 1798, Vauquelin discovered that he could isolate metallic chromium by heating the oxide in a charcoal oven. He was also able to detect traces of chromium in precious gemstones, such as ruby, or emerald. Later this year he successfully isolated chromium atoms.  \n" +

"Manganese is used to decolourize glass (removing the greenish tinge that presence of iron produces) and, in higher concentration, make violet-coloured glass.  \n" +
"Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) is a potent oxidizer and used in chemistry and in medicine as a disinfectant.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"The origin of the name manganese is complex. In ancient times, two black minerals from Magnesia in what is now modern Greece were both called magnes, but were thought to differ in gender. The male magnes attracted iron, and was the iron ore we now know as loadstone or magnetite, and which probably gave us the term magnet. The female magnes ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolourize glass. This feminine magnes was later called magnesia, known now in modern times as pyrolusite (MnO2) or manganese dioxide. This mineral is never magnetic (although manganese itself is paramagnetic). In the 16th century, it was called manganesum by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption of two words since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a magnesia negra (the black ore) from magnesia alba (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). Mercati called magnesia negra Manganesa, and finally the metal isolated from it became known as manganese (German: Mangan). The name magnesia eventually was then used to refer only to the white magnesia alba (magnesium oxide), which provided the name magnesium for that free element, when it was eventually isolated, much later.  \n" +
"Manganese compounds were in use in prehistoric times; paints that were pigmented with manganese dioxide can be traced back 17,000 years. The Egyptians and Romans used manganese compounds in glass-making, to either remove colour from glass or add colour to it. Manganese can be found in the iron ores used by the Spartans. Some speculate that the exceptional hardness of Spartan steels derives from the inadvertent production of an iron-manganese alloy.  \n" +
"In the 17th century, German chemist Johann Glauber first produced permanganate, a useful laboratory reagent (although some people believe that it was discovered by Ignites Kaim in 1770). By the mid-18th century, manganese dioxide was in use in the manufacture of chlorine (which it produces when mixed with hydrochloric acid (HCl), or commercially with a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride). The Swedish chemist Scheele was the first to recognize that manganese was an element, and his colleague, Johan Gottlieb Gahn, isolated the pure element in 1774 by reduction of the dioxide with carbon. Around the beginning of the 19th century, scientists began exploring the use of manganese in steelmaking, with patents being granted for its use at the time. In 1816, it was noted that adding manganese to iron made it harder, without making it any more brittle. In 1837, British academic James Couper noted an association between heavy exposure to manganese in mines with a form of Parkinson's Disease. In 1912, manganese phosphating electrochemical conversion coatings for protecting firearms against rust and corrosion were patented in the United States, and have seen widespread use ever since.  \n" +
"In the 20th century, manganese dioxide has seen wide commercial use as the chief cathodic material for commercial disposable dry cells and dry batteries of both the standard (carbon-zinc) and alkaline type.  \n" +

Cast iron was first produced in China about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the medieval period, means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron (in this context known as pig iron) using finery forges. For all these processes, charcoal was required as fuel.  \n" +
"Steel (with a smaller carbon content than pig iron but more than wrought iron) was first produced in antiquity. New methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century AD. In the Industrial Revolution, new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s, Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to wrought iron no longer being produced.  \n" +

"Swedish chemist Georg Brandt (1694-1768) is credited with isolating cobalt sometime between 1730 and 1737. He was able to show that cobalt was the source of the blue colour in glass, which previously had been attributed to the bismuth found with cobalt.  \n" +
"During the 19th century, cobalt blue was produced at the Norwegian Blaafarvevaerket (70-80% of world production), led by the Prussian industrialist Benjamin Wegner. In 1938, John Livingood and Glenn Seaborg discovered cobalt-60.  \n" +
"The word cobalt is derived from the German kobalt, from kobold meaning \"goblin\", a term used for the ore of cobalt by miners. The first attempts at smelting the cobalt ores to produce cobalt metal failed, yielding cobalt(II) oxide instead; not only that, but because of cobalt's curious affinity for arsenic, the primary ores of cobalt always contain arsenic, and upon smelting the arsenic oxidized into the highly toxic As4O6, which was breathed in by workers.  \n" +

"Cobalt in small amounts is essential to many living organisms, including humans. Having 0.13 to 0.30 mg/kg of cobalt in soils markedly improves the health of grazing animals. Cobalt is a central component of the vitamin cobalamin, or vitamin B-12.  \n" +

" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"The use of Nickel is ancient, and can be traced back as far as 3500 BC. Bronzes from what is now Syria had a nickel content of up to 2%. Further, there are Chinese manuscripts suggesting that \"white copper\" (i.e. baitung) was used in the Orient between 1700 and 1400 BC. However, because the ores of nickel were easily mistaken for ores of silver, any understanding of this metal and its use dates to more contemporary times.  \n" +
"Minerals containing nickel (e.g. kupfernickel, meaning copper of the devil (\"Nick\"), or false copper) were of value for colouring glass green. In 1751, Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt was attempting to extract copper from kupfernickel (now called niccolite (NiAs)), and obtained instead a white metal that he called nickel.  \n" +
"In the United States, the term \"nickel\" or \"nick\" was originally applied to the copper-nickel Indian cent coin introduced in 1859. Later, the name designated the three-cent coin introduced in 1865, and the following year the five-cent shield nickel appropriated the designation, which has remained ever since. Coins of pure nickel were first used in 1881 in Switzerland.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Nickel is magnetic (although the US 'nickel' coin is not as it is mostly copper).  \n" +

" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Copper, as native copper, is one of the few metals to naturally occur as an uncompounded mineral. Copper was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record, and has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old. A copper pendant was found in what is now northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. By 5000 BC, there are signs of copper smelting, the refining of copper from simple copper compounds such as malachite or azurite. Among archaeological sites in Anatolia, Catal Hoyuk (~6000 BC) features native copper artifacts and smelted lead beads, but no smelted copper. But Can Hasan (~5000 BCE) had access to smelted copper; this site has yielded the oldest known cast copper artifact, a copper mace head.  \n" +
"Copper smelting appears to have been developed independently in several parts of the world. In addition to its development in Anatolia by 5000 BCE, it was developed in China before 2800 BCE, in the Andes around 2000 BCE, in Central America around 600 AD, and in West Africa around 900 AD. Copper is found extensively in the Indus Valley Civilization by the 3rd millennium BC. In Europe, Otzi the Iceman, a well-preserved male dated to 3200 BC, was found with a copper-tipped axe whose metal was 99.7% pure. High levels of arsenic in his hair suggest he was involved in copper smelting. There are copper and bronze artifacts from Sumerian cities that date to 3000 BC, and Egyptian artifacts of copper and copper-tin alloys nearly as old. In one pyramid, a copper plumbing system was found that is 5000 years old. The Egyptians found that adding a small amount of tin made the metal easier to cast, so bronze alloys were found in Egypt almost as soon as copper was found. In the Americas production in the Old Copper Complex, located in present day Michigan and Wisconsin, was dated back to between 6000 to 3000 BC.  \n" +
"The use of bronze became so pervasive in a certain era of civilization that it has been named the Bronze Age. The transitional period in certain regions between the preceding Neolithic period and the Bronze Age is termed the Chalcolithic (\"copper-stone\"), with some high-purity copper tools being used alongside stone tools. Brass was known to the Greeks, but only became a significant supplement to bronze during the Roman empire.  \n" +
"In Greek the metal was known by the name chalkos. Copper was a very important resource for the Romans, Greeks and other ancient peoples. In Roman times, it became known as aes Cyprium (aes being the generic Latin term for copper alloys such as bronze and other metals, and Cyprium because so much of it was mined in Cyprus). From this, the phrase was simplified to cuprum and then eventually Anglicized into the English copper. Copper was associated with the goddess Aphrodite/Venus in mythology and alchemy, owing to its lustrous beauty, its ancient use in producing mirrors, and its association with Cyprus, which was sacred to the goddess. In alchemy the symbol for copper was also the symbol for the planet Venus.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Copper is essential in all higher plants and animals. Copper is carried mostly in the bloodstream on a plasma protein called ceruloplasmin. When copper is first absorbed in the gut it is transported to the liver bound to albumin. Copper is found in a variety of enzymes.  \n" +
"Copper is a very interesting element. It is one of the transition elements that actually uses electrons from one of the inner orbitals in chemical reactions. In addition, it has more than one oxidation state. Like many of the transition elements, copper has a coloured ion. Copper typically forms a bluish green solution. Copper (Cu) has two valences Cu I (cuprous) has one valence electron and Cu II (cupric) has two valence electrons. Copper was one of the earliest known metals, having reportedly been mined for over 5000 years. In nature it has two isotopes, 63 (69.09%), which has 29 electrons and protons and 34 neutrons, and 65 (30.91%), which has 29 electrons and protons and 36 neutrons. Brass and bronze are alloys of copper.  \n" +

" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"In ancient India the production of zinc metal was very common. Many mine sites of Zawarmaala were active even during 1300-1000 BC. There are references of medicinal uses of zinc in the Charaka Samhita (300 BC). The Rasaratna Samuccaya (800 AD) explains the existence of two types of ores for zinc metal, one of which is ideal for metal extraction while the other is used for medicinal purpose. Zinc alloys have been used for centuries, as brass goods dating to 1000-1400 BC have been found in Israel and zinc objects with 87% zinc have been found in prehistoric Transylvania. Because of the low boiling point and high chemical reactivity of this metal (isolated zinc would tend to go up the chimney rather than be captured), the true nature of this metal was not understood in ancient times.  \n" +
"The manufacture of brass was known to the Ebi by about 30 BC, using a technique where calamine and copper were heated together in a crucible. The zinc oxides in calamine were reduced, and the free zinc metal was trapped by the copper, forming an alloy. The resulting calamine brass was either cast or hammered into shape.  \n" +
"Smelting and extraction of impure forms of zinc was accomplished as early as 1000 AD in India and China. In the West, impure zinc as a remnant in melting ovens was known since Antiquity, but usually discarded as worthless. Strabo mentions it as pseudo-arguros - \"mock silver\". The Berne zinc tablet is a votive plaque dating to Roman Gaul, probably made from such zinc remnants.  \n" +
"Dr John Lane is said to have carried out experiments, probably at Landore, prior to his bankruptcy in 1726. Postlewayt's Universal Dictionary, the most authentic source of all technological information in Europe, did not mention zinc before 1751.  \n" +
"In 1738, William Champion patented in Great Britain a process to extract zinc from calamine in a smelter, using a technology somewhat similar to that used at Zawar zinc mines in Rajasthan. However, there is no evidence that he visited the orient.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"The earth has been estimated to have 46 years supply of zinc. A chemist estimated in 2007 that at the current rate of usage, the world's supply of zinc would be exhausted by about the year 2037.  \n" +

"Gallium was discovered spectroscopically by Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1875 by its characteristic spectrum (two violet lines) in an examination of a zinc blende from the Pyrenees. Before its discovery, most of its properties had been predicted and described by Dmitri Mendeleev (who called the hypothetical element eka-aluminium) on the basis of its position in his periodic table. Later, in 1875, Boisbaudran obtained the free metal through the electrolysis of its hydroxide in KOH solution. He named the element \"gallia\" after his native land of France. It was later claimed that, in one of those multilingual puns so beloved of men of science of the early 19th century, he also named it after himself, as 'Lecoq' = the rooster, and Latin for rooster is \"gallus\"; however, he denied this in an 1877 article.  \n" +

Vintage effects pedals known to contain germanium transistors have shown marked increases in collector value for this reason alone.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"In 1871, germanium (Latin Germania for Germany) was one of the elements that Dmitri Mendeleev predicted to exist as a missing analogue of the silicon group (Mendeleev called it \"ekasilicon\"). The existence of this element was proven by Clemens Winkler in 1886. This discovery was an important confirmation of Mendeleev's idea of element periodicity.  \n" +
"The development of the germanium transistor opened the door to countless applications of solid state electronics. From 1950 through the early 1970s, this area provided an increasing market for germanium, but then high purity silicon began replacing germanium in transistors, diodes, and rectifiers. Silicon has superior electrical properties, but requires much higher purity samples-a purity which could not be commercially achieved in the early days. Meanwhile, demand for germanium in fiber optics communication networks, infrared night vision systems, and polymerization catalysts increased dramatically. These end uses represented 85% of worldwide germanium consumption for 2000.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Its occurrence is 0.0007% of the earth's crust. In the elemental form it is a lustrous white, brittle metalloid. When crystalized it has a diamond cubic structure. It is a poor conductor and is used in electronics in rectifying devices and transistors. It is also used in dental alloys. There are several compounds which contain germanium. \"Germaine\" or germanium hydride is a colourless gas GeH4 prepared by the action of lithium aluminium hydride on germanium halide in an ether solution. Germaine is a hazardous substance UN2192 which is classified as a poisonous gas (2.3). It is also a flammable gas (2.1).

"Selenium was discovered in 1817 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius who found the element associated with tellurium (named for the Earth).  \n" +
"Growth in selenium consumption was historically driven by steady development of new uses, including applications in rubber compounding, steel alloying, and selenium rectifiers. By 1970, selenium in rectifiers had largely been replaced by silicon, but its use as a photoconductor in plain paper copiers had become its leading application. During the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although it was still a large end-use) as more and more copiers using organic photoconductors were produced. Presently, the largest use of selenium world-wide is in glass manufacturing, followed by uses in chemicals and pigments. Electronic use, despite a number of continued applications, continues to decline.  \n" +
"In 1996, continuing research showed a positive correlation between selenium supplementation and cancer prevention in humans, but widespread direct application of this important finding would not add significantly to demand owing to the small doses required. In the late 1990s, the use of selenium (usually with bismuth) as an additive to plumbing brasses to meet no-lead environmental standards, became important. At present, total world selenium production continues to increase modestly.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Conducts electricity when struck by light. Selenium is found (and even appears to be required at very low levels) in humans, but in trace amounts.  \n" +
"Some clinical studies have shown that selenium may help cut the risk of certain cancers. \n" +
" \n" +
"Hazards  \n" +
"Selenium and its compounds are extremely toxic and behave in the same way as arsenic. May be fatal if inhaled, ingested or absorbed through skin.  "+"");

"Bromine is used to make brominated vegetable oil, which is used as an emulsifier in many citrus-flavoured soft drinks. \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Bromine was discovered by Antoine Balard at the salt marshes of Montpellier in 1826, but was not produced in quantity until 1860. The French chemist and physicist Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac suggested the name bromine due to the characteristic smell of the vapours.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Bromine is highly reactive and is a powerful oxidizing agent in the presence of water. It reacts vigorously with amines, alkenes and phenols as well as aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones and acids (these are brominated by either addition or substitution reactions). With many of the metals and elements, anhydrous bromine is less reactive than hydrated bromine; however, dry bromine reacts vigorously with aluminium, titanium, mercury as well as alkaline earth metals and alkali metals.  \n" +
"Because of its high cost, bromine is usually recycled rather than disposed of into the environment. \n" +
"About 500 million kilograms of bromine are produced each year worldwide, with the USA and Israel being the main producers.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Hazards  \n" +
"May be fatal if inhaled, highly toxic b inhalation, ingestion or skin contact. \n" +
"Elemental bromine is a strong irritant and, in concentrated form, will produce painful blisters on exposed skin and especially mucous membranes.

" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Yttrium was discovered by Finnish chemist, physicist, and mineralogist Johann Gadolin in 1794 and isolated by Friedrich Wöhler in 1828 as an impure extract of yttria through the reduction of yttrium anhydrous chloride (YCl3) with potassium. Yttria (Y2O3) is the oxide of yttrium and was discovered by Johann Gadolin in 1794 in a gadolinite mineral from Ytterby.  \n" +
"In 1843, the great Swedish chemist Carl Mosander was able to show that yttria could be divided into the oxides (or earths) of three different elements. \"Yttria\" was the name which was retained for the most basic one, which also happened to comprise the bulk of the crude mixture (typically about two-thirds) and the others were re-named erbia and terbia.

"History  \n" +
"Iodine was discovered by Bernard Courtois in 1811. He was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter (a vital part of gunpowder). At the time France was at war, saltpeter, a component of gunpowder, was in great demand. Saltpeter produced from French niter beds required sodium carbonate, which could be isolated from seaweed washed up on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the sodium carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash then washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid. One day Courtois added too much sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose. Courtois noted that the vapour crystallized on cold surfaces making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this was a new element but lacked the money to pursue his observations.  \n" +
"However he gave samples to his friends, Charles Bernard Desormes (1777 - 1862) and Nicolas Clement (1779 - 1841), to continue research. He also gave some of the substance to Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778 - 1850), a well-known chemist at that time, and to Andre-Marie Ampere (1775 - 1836). On 29 November 1813, Dersormes and Clement made public Courtois' discovery. They described the substance to a meeting of the Imperial Institute of France. On December 6, Gay-Lussac announced that the new substance was either an element or a compound of oxygen. Ampere had given some of his sample to Humphry Davy (1778 - 1829). Davy did some experiments on the substance and noted its similarity to chlorine. Davy sent a letter dated December 10 to the Royal Society of London stating that he had identified a new element. A large argument erupted between Davy and Gay-Lussac over who identified iodine first but both scientists acknowledged Bernard Courtois as the first to isolate the chemical element.  \n" +

Some rare-earth chlorides, such as lanthanum chloride (LaCl3), are known to have anticoagulant properties.  \n" +
"Small amounts of lanthanum added to steel improves its malleability, resistance to impact and ductility; added to iron helps to produce nodular cast iron; added to molybdenum decreases the hardness of this metal and its sensitivity to temperature variations.  \n" +
"Hydrogen sponge alloys can contain lanthanum. These alloys are capable of storing up to 400 times their own volume of hydrogen gas in a reversible adsorption process.  \n" +
"Lanthanum Hexaboride (LaB6) crystals are used in high brightness, extended life, thermionic electron emission sources for scanning electron microscopes.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Lanthanum was discovered in 1839 by Swedish chemist Carl Gustav Mosander, when he partially decomposed a sample of cerium nitrate by heating and treating the resulting salt with dilute nitric acid. From the resulting solution, he isolated a new rare earth he called lantana. Lanthanum was isolated in relatively pure form in 1923.  \n" +
"Lanthanum is the most strongly basic of all the trivalent lanthanoids, and this property is what allowed Mosander to isolate and purify the salts of this element. Basicity separation as operated commercially involved the fractional precipitation of the weaker bases (such as \"didymium\") from nitrate solution by the addition of magnesium oxide or dilute ammmonia gas. Purified lanthanum remained in solution. (The basicity methods were only suitable for lanthanum purification; \"didymium\" could not be efficiently further separated in this manner.) The alternative technique of fractional crystallization was invented by Dimitry Mendeleev himself, in the form of the double ammonium nitrate tetrahydrate, which he used to separate the less-soluble lanthanum from the more-soluble \"didymium\" in the 1870's. This system would be used commercially in lanthanum purification until the development of practical solvent extraction methods that started in the late 1950's. (A detailed process using the double ammonium nitrates to provide 4N pure lanthanum, neodymium concentrates and praseodymium concentrates is presented in Callow 1967, at a time when the process was just becoming obsolete.) As operated for lanthanum purification, the double ammonium nitrates were recrystallized from water. When later adapted by Carl Auer won Welsbach for the splitting of \"didymium\", nitric acid was used as solvent to lower the solubiity of the system. Lanthanum is relatively easy to purify, since it has only one adjacent lanthanoids, cerium, which itself is very readily removed due to its potential tetravalency.  \n" +

"Notes  \n" +
"Cold water attacks lanthanum slowly, while hot water attacks it much more rapidly. \n" +

"Hazards  \n" +
"In animals, the injection of lanthanum solutions produces glycaemia, low blood pressure, degeneration of the spleen and hepatic alterations.  \n" +

" \n" +
"Uses  \n" +
"Used to produce metals that have high melting points, are strong and have good ductility. Alloyed with other metals, it is also used in making carbide tools for metalworking equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components, chemical process equipment, nuclear reactors, and missile parts. Because of its ductility, tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments, which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium.  \n" +
"Tantalum pentoxide is used in capacitors, condensers, cutting tools, vacuum tube filaments and in camera lenses to increase refracting power. Because it is totally immune to the action of body liquids and is nonirritating it is widely used in making surgical appliances.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Tantalum was discovered in Sweden in 1802 by Anders Ekeberg and isolated in 1820 by Jöns Berzelius. Many contemporary chemists believed niobium and tantalum were the same elements until 1844 and later 1866 when researchers showed that niobic and tantalic acids were different compounds. Early investigators were only able to isolate impure metal and the first relatively pure ductile metal was produced by Werner von Bolton in 1903. Wires made with tantalum metal were used for light bulbs until tungsten replaced it.  \n" +
"Its name is derived from the character Tantalus, father of Niobe in Greek mythology, who was punished after death by being condemned to stand knee-deep in water with perfect fruit growing above his head, both of which eternally tantalized him - if he bent to drink the water, it drained below the level he could reach, and if he reached for the fruit, the branches moved out of his grasp. This was considered similar to tantalum's general non-reactivity-it sits among reagents and is unaffected by them. The English word tantalize was named after Tantalus, and tantalum was named after the tantalizing problems posed by the inertness of the element and its compounds.  \n" +
"For many years, the commercial technology for separating tantalum from niobium involved the fractional crystallization of potassium heptafluorotantalate away from potassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate, that had been discovered by Marignac in the 1860s. The method has been supplanted by solvent extraction from fluoride-containing solutions.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"The metal is renowned for its resistance to corrosion by acids; in fact, at temperatures below 150°C tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia. It can only be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide (SO3).  \n" +
"Previously know as tantalium. \n" +

"Tungsten is a metal with a wide range of uses, the largest of which is as tungsten carbide (W2C, WC), which is one the hardest substances in existence. Cemented carbides (also called hardmetals) are wear-resistant materials used by the metalworking, mining, petroleum and construction industries. Tungsten is widely used in light bulb and vacuum tube filaments, as well as electrodes, because it can be drawn into very thin metal wires that have a high melting point.  \n" +
"When alloyed in small quantities with steel, it greatly increases its hardness. Used widely in the electronics industry. Made into filaments for vacuum tubes and electric lights. Also used in contact points in cars, heat sinks, weights, counterweights, welding electrodes, rocket nozzles and cutting tools. Combined with calcium or magnesium it makes phosphors.  \n" +
"Composites are used as a substitute for lead in bullets and shot.  \n" +
"Recently, Tungsten Carbide has been used in the fashioning of jewellery due to its hypoallergenic nature and the fact that due to its extreme hardness it is not apt to lose its luster like other polished metals.  \n" +
" \n" +
"History  \n" +
"Tungsten (Swedish tung sten meaning \"heavy stone\"), even though the current name for the element in Swedish is wolfram (sometimes spelled in Swedish as volfram), from the denomination volf rahm by Wallerius in 1747, translated from the description by Agricola in 1546 as Lupi spuma, meaning \"wolf's froth\" after the way tin is eaten up like a wolf after sheep in the process of its extraction.  \n" +
"It was first hypothesized to exist by Peter Woulfe in 1779 who examined wolframite and concluded that it must contain a new substance. In 1781 Karl Wilhelm Scheele ascertained that a new acid could be made from tungstenite. Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested that it could be possible to obtain a new metal by reducing tungstic acid. In 1783 Jose and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid in wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid. In Spain later that year the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten through reduction of this acid with charcoal. They are credited with the discovery of the element.  \n" +
"In World War II, tungsten played an enormous role in background political dealings. Portugal, as the main European source of the element, was put under pressure from both sides, because of its sources of wolframite ore. The resistance to high temperatures, as well as the extreme strength of its alloys, made the metal into a very important raw material for the weaponry industry.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Some sources give the German chemist Karl Wilhelm Scheele as the first to isolate the metal, three years before the d'Elhuyar brothers, in 1780.  \n" +
"The light bulb manufacturer OSRAM (founded in 1906 when three German companies; Auer-Gesellerschaft, AEG and Siemens and Halske combined their lamp production facilities), derived its name from the elements of OSmium and wolfRAM - OSRAM.  \n" +

"History  \n" +
"Rhenium was the last naturally occurring element to be discovered. The existence of a yet undiscovered element at this position in the periodic table had been predicted by Henry Moseley in 1914. It is generally considered to have been discovered by Walter Noddack, Ida Tacke, and Otto Berg in Germany. In 1925 they reported that they detected the element in platinum ore and in the mineral columbite. They also found rhenium in gadolinite ([(Fe, Mn)(Nb, Ta)2O6]) and molybdenite (MoS2). In 1928 they were able to extract 1 g of element by processing 660 kg of molybdenite.  \n" +
"The process was so complicated and the cost so high that production was discontinued until early 1950 when tungsten-rhenium and molybdenum-rhenium alloys were prepared. These alloys found important applications in industry that resulted in a great demand for the rhenium produced from the molybdenite fraction of porphyry copper ores.  \n" +
"In 1908, Japanese chemist Masataka Ogawa announced that he discovered the 43rd element, and named it nipponium (Np) after Japan (which is Nippon in Japanese). However, later analysis indicated the presence of rhenium (element 75), not element 43. The symbol Np was later used for the element neptunium.  \n" +
" \n" +
"Notes  \n" +
"Rhenium is a metallic element that has a very high tensile strength (80,000psi), high modulus of elasticity, is virtually insoluble in hydrochloric acid and does not oxidize or corrode in saltwater. In addition it has the widest range of valences of any element and it retains its crystalline structure all the way to its melting point. Alloys of rhenium-molybdenum are superconductive at 10K.  \n" +
